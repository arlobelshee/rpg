# Leader

Enabler & to-hit bonuses
 * Elle likes enabling, because she likes hitting hard with her striker
 * With our AoE focus, we will roll lots of hit rolls. Damage and status effects depend on hitting, so best value is to help hit a lot (debuffing or buffing)

# Controller

AoE Forced movement & status ailments - action economy
 * heroic --- slide + slow + prone

Not done:
 * enchantment / dominate a foe --- it isn't AoE, and only puts one of them out of commission

Wizard / ?? / Soul of the World (because Deva)


PP:
 * Morninglord --- ignite the mafia
 * Divine Oracle --- double roll all attacks vs will. Use at-will to target enemies in area, changed to psychic + thunder to stack ailments and forced movement

ED:
 * Soul of the World --- dragonborn for breath shenanigans + off-class powers
 * Demigod/Chosen/etc --- int bonus to hit better

# Striker

AoE (sorc)
Yakuza theme --- force individuals to surrender --- would need to replace current one which lets her understand enemy languages

Elementalist / ?? / ??

Feats
 * Arcane Spellfury, Focusing Spellfury, Rising Spellfury

PP:
 * Morninglord --- ignite the mafia --- Elle might enjoy starting the damage bonus for everyone. Would need to make her spectacularly good at hitting. Also find ways to expand her AoE radius. Thunder + echoes is only real option (Enlarge only affects wizard spells). Elementalist limited power selection makes arcane admixture maybe suffice. MC to get holy symbols, then crusader's hammer (convert half to radiant), symbol of divine light (increase radiant vuln)
 * Speaker of Xaos - Elemental damage optimization
 * Academy Master - At-will optimization
 * Lightnight Fury - Lightning optimization (but may be less useful in radiant mafia)
 * Essence Mage - optimize 2-element attacks
 * Demonskin Adept - add leader abilities & DPR. Requires robe of Eyes or other counter to blind to make awesome at 16th

ED:
 * Avangion - add radiant to everything. Lots of medic stuff.
 * Avatar of Storm - all lightning or thunder becomes lightning and thunder. Expand AoE, add PP bonuses, do Oncoming Storm attack bonus, etc. Also works with Essence Mage, if go that way.
 * Destined Scion - bonuses to hit & ability scores. Boring but strong.
 * Draconic Incarnation - become a dragon. And get 2xlvl25 arcane powers from other classes
 * Lyrandar Wind Rider - bonus atk and damage for lightning & thunder powers
 * 

# Defender

Sticky Melee (Knight or Fighter)

Enable-able
 * Agile Opportunist
 * Good MBA
 * Hit multiple with MBA? For mafia.

Crusader's hammer? Convert half to radiant, leave rest (eg, lightning)

Knight:
 * Slow at will; World Serpent's Grasp to prone
 * Slide everything --- Lashing flail at P, lightning + mark of storms

Fighter:
 * Infinite THP --- battlerager.
 * MC, then pick feat to add other stat to AC? --- can use light armors (trollskin hide?)
 * The feat or item that adds CON mod to any regen. With regen while bloodied (sash item property?)
 * Cleave --- damage to several, can I get as an MBA?
 * Hammer or flail?
