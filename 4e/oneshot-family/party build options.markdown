# Leader

Warlord|Artificer / ?? / ??

Enabler & to-hit bonuses
 * Elle likes enabling, because she likes hitting hard with her striker
 * With our AoE focus, we will roll lots of hit rolls. Damage and status effects depend on hitting, so best value is to help hit a lot (debuffing or buffing)

# Controller

Wizard / Morninglord / Soul of the World

AoE Forced movement & status ailments - action economy
 * heroic --- slide + slow + prone

Not done:
 * enchantment / dominate a foe --- it isn't AoE, and only puts one of them out of commission

MC to get holy symbols, then crusader's hammer (convert half to radiant), symbol of divine light (increase radiant vuln). Paladin MC - esp if add sanction?

PP:
 * Morninglord --- ignite the mafia
 * ~~Divine Oracle --- double roll all attacks vs will. Use at-will to target enemies in area, changed to psychic + thunder to stack ailments and forced movement~~

ED:
 * Soul of the World --- dragonborn for breath shenanigans + off-class powers
 * ~~Demigod/Chosen/etc --- int bonus to hit better~~

# Striker

AoE (sorc)
Yakuza theme --- force individuals to surrender --- would need to replace current one which lets her understand enemy languages

Elementalist / ?? / ??

Feats
 * Arcane Spellfury, Focusing Spellfury, Rising Spellfury

PP:
 * Speaker of Xaos - Elemental damage optimization
 * Academy Master - At-will optimization
 * Lightnight Fury - Lightning optimization (but may be less useful in radiant mafia)
 * Essence Mage - optimize 2-element attacks
 * Demonskin Adept - add leader abilities & DPR. Requires robe of Eyes or other counter to blind to make awesome at 16th
 * Lyrandar Wind Rider - bonus atk and damage for lightning & thunder powers

ED:
 * Avangion - add radiant to everything. Lots of medic stuff.
 * Avatar of Storm - all lightning or thunder becomes lightning and thunder. Expand AoE, add PP bonuses, do Oncoming Storm attack bonus, etc. Also works with Essence Mage, if go that way.
 * Destined Scion - bonuses to hit & ability scores. Boring but strong.
 * Draconic Incarnation - become a dragon. And get 2xlvl25 arcane powers from other classes
