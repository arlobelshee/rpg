# 5e Chars to Build

Not all intended to be in one party, just interesting concepts

  * Many ranged attacks, doesn't miss. Probably Warlock base, with some Sorc (quicken an eldritch strike).
	* Largest possible damage single attack, many ways to get it out of turn (reaction, ally bonus action, etc). Probably rogue, maybe barbarian. Either Booming Blade rogue or an archer...but need to guarantee sneak attack.
	* Divine Soul sorc - pick all the best spells off anyone's list. Probably no multiclassing.
	* Wizard, straight utility / save-or-suck with one or two blaster options just for when there are lots of foes, filling in other roles, best ritual magic.
	* Party damage mitigation or healer. Cleric is obvious choice, but see what else would work - especially if could double into one of the other builds without weakening it.
	* Optimal defender. What lock-down mechanics exist in 5e, especially for action denial to more than one foe?
	* Optimal support leader builds? Action granting, bonus damage / to hit granting, not chessmaster (use ranged-happy chars to not need chessmastering as much).

## Need to Learn / understand.

Limits emposed by concentration requirement. How much attack / damage bonus is possible, given conc requirements? What spells can I cast while concentrating?

What bonuses are available without a concentration requirement?

What are all the sources of flat damage bonuses, especially granted to someone else? Only include ones that don't have a direct usage limit (requiers spell with multi-round duration is OK, but requires using a charge per attack that recharges per short rest is not).

Are there any breaks to action economy, even with attack granting? As simple as using a bonus action to grant someone else an attack would still be helpful. Look at fighter - is there a way to use a single strike in an attack sequence to grant an attack to someone else? How many different roles could do something useful in a round and also grant an attack to the rogue?

## Multishot Archer

Concept: maximize number of ranged attacks. Maximize the effect of leader-granted to-hit and damage bonuses.
