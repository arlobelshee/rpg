# Now with more knowledge

* Shadow Sorc 6+ / ??? - save debuff illusions, enchants, save-or-suck striker/controller
  * With Cleric (Twilight?) - armor, good cleric domain bonus
	* With Warlock (hex - armor / shield) - short rest SP slots (need 3 levels to get 4 SP - ouch)
	* As Warlock primary (loses high-level spells, even as warlock)
* Warlock 2 - illusion at will invocation.
* Illusionist? - key ability is at level 14 (make illusion real). Can mold illusions at 6. So only if going full wizard
* terror paladin - Undead Warlock + Aggro Paladin - frighten and cower enemies. Plus save bonus for party.
* Divine soul sorc (dev, fly at 14, self heal at 18)
* Gun savant
	* Bladesinger / Artillerist / Warlock (or maybe Ranger) in some combo
	* Artillerist doesn't quite work RAW, as the artillery piece is a magic thing, not a firearm. Would require houserule to use it as a firearm. Even then, it is just a 1d8 force weapon (gains extra d8s at 9 & 17)
	* Bladesinger doesn't work RAW, as Int to damage is for melee attacks only. It comes at 14, so only works if Wizard is primary.
	* Warlock hex gives +prof bonus to all damage rolls (even not attacks!)...but can't move the hex on until level 14. So only useful on the BBEG
	* Hex spell
	* Extra attack = 1 martial attack + 1 cantrip -> gunshot using artillery + eld blast
	* Bonus attack: grant artillery an attack
	* Do all this while maintaining concentration. Either control spell (web, hypnotic pattern, wall of force) or damage adder (hex)
	* Try to combine +Int from Bladesinger with +Cha from Warlock on as much as possible. Convert all attacks to be Cha based or Int based, keep dex at level for med armor
	* Get barrier tattoo that matches med armor. Use mage armor until then (and just have a lower AC)
* Martial attack granter / (support or controller)
	* Cleric of Order + [Sorc or Wizard - anything with silvery barbs]
	* Bns act: healing word -> grant an attack
	* React: silvery barbs -> grant an attack to one you grant adv to
	* Requires 2 martials with strong single attacks




# 5e Chars to Build

Not all intended to be in one party, just interesting concepts

  * Many ranged attacks, doesn't miss. Probably Warlock base, with some Sorc (quicken an eldritch strike).
	* Largest possible damage single attack, many ways to get it out of turn (reaction, ally bonus action, etc). Probably rogue, maybe barbarian. Either Booming Blade rogue or an archer...but need to guarantee sneak attack.
	* Divine Soul sorc - pick all the best spells off anyone's list. Probably no multiclassing.
	* Wizard, straight utility / save-or-suck with one or two blaster options just for when there are lots of foes, filling in other roles, best ritual magic.
	* Party damage mitigation or healer. Cleric is obvious choice, but see what else would work - especially if could double into one of the other builds without weakening it.
	* Optimal defender. What lock-down mechanics exist in 5e, especially for action denial to more than one foe?
	* Optimal support leader builds? Action granting, bonus damage / to hit granting, not chessmaster (use ranged-happy chars to not need chessmastering as much).

## Need to Learn / understand.

Limits emposed by concentration requirement. How much attack / damage bonus is possible, given conc requirements? What spells can I cast while concentrating?

What bonuses are available without a concentration requirement?

What are all the sources of flat damage bonuses, especially granted to someone else? Only include ones that don't have a direct usage limit (requiers spell with multi-round duration is OK, but requires using a charge per attack that recharges per short rest is not).

Are there any breaks to action economy, even with attack granting? As simple as using a bonus action to grant someone else an attack would still be helpful. Look at fighter - is there a way to use a single strike in an attack sequence to grant an attack to someone else? How many different roles could do something useful in a round and also grant an attack to the rogue?

## Multishot Archer

Concept: maximize number of ranged attacks. Maximize the effect of leader-granted to-hit and damage bonuses.
